              Ternary Operators --> which are denoted by "?:" in which there should be a condition then ? "true case" : "false case";
              
              Nested ternary operators -->  These can also be nested which can replace complex if..else statements
              
                                            let day = 3;
                                            let greeting = (day === 1) ? 'Start of the week' :
                                            (day === 2) ? 'Second day' :
                                            (day === 3) ? 'Midweek' :
                                            (day === 4) ? 'Almost weekend' :
                                            'Weekend';
                                            console.log(greeting);
              
              Switch case --> The switch statement evaluates an expression and executes         code based on matching cases. It’s an efficient alternative to multiple if-else statements,improving readability when handling many conditions.

              Break and continue --> break and continue are used to control loop execution. break immediately terminates a loop when a condition is met, while continue Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next loop iteration.

              Loops --> Loops in JavaScript allow a block of code to run multiple times as long as a given condition is satisfied. They help reduce repetition and make programs more efficient and organized.

                for loop --> 
                            The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.

                while loop -->
                            The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

                do-while loop -->
                            The do...while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.
